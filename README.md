# Did someone touch this?

The idea behind the app is to take a photo before and after you leave your room/luggage.
The app then compares both photos to spot differences. This should allow the user to detect when his belongings have been tampered with / stolen from / searched.

There once was an app called Photo Trap, but sadly I only learned of it *after* it was pulled from the App Store.

## Demo

I host a version of the app [here](https://projects.six-two.dev/react_did_someone_touch_this), but it might sometimes lag behind the master branch.

## Privacy

By design all processing is done on your device.
This means none of your data are uploaded to a server. I use some third party libraries, but as far as I know they don't steal your information ðŸ˜‰.

## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
